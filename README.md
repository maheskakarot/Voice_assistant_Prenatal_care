# Voice_assistant_Prenatal_care

This project is developed to help pregnant women living in rural areas.
In some rural places hospitals are located far away from their home and chances of spreading fake information is really high. To help illitarate women by providing some basic information related to pregnancy we created this virtual assistant which can be accessed through voice for easier access. by ruuning the file gui_with_voice.ipynb by providing the location of the trained model and pickle files we can directly run the assistant and by using the button speak we can communicate with the assistant.

LIMITATIONS:
    Response time of assistant totally depends on the available network bandwidth.
