# Voice_assistant_Prenatal_care

In rural areas hospitals are located far away from home and people are often needed to perform first aid measures in times of emergency but people aren't aware of them. We may find some misleading information online and taking action based on random news on the internet is never recommended hence to solve this problem I developed a personal assistant to provide first aid measures to be taken during an emergency. All the First aid measures that are provided by the assistant are verifed and recommended by doctors.

Programming language used : Python
Libraries used : Keras,NLTK, Pandas, Numpy, Pickle, Tkinter, speech_recognition, pyttsx3
